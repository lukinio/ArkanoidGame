#### Setup

- Clone the project out of GitHub and then run:
```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Gameplay
--------
The player controls the "Vaus", a space vessel that acts as the game's "paddle" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks. The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, equip a laser cannon, extra life.)
